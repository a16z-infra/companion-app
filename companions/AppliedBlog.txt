Case Study: Using Synthetic Data to Improve Traffic Sign Classification and Achieve Regulatory Compliance (April 20, 2023):
Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on perception models
to accurately detect and classify traffic signs in compliance with required safety technology
such as Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA). To train these perception models, ADAS and AV programs
require significant amounts of diverse, accurately labeled data. Given the large variations in
traffic sign appearance, illumination, weather (Figure 1), and occlusions, it is often expensive
and sometimes impossible to collect real-world data that covers all possible scenarios. Using
Applied Intuition’s Synthetic Datasets such as Traffic Sign Datasets, ADAS and AV programs can
accelerate perception model development while ensuring that resulting models are robust and can
perform well in the real world. Applied’s perception simulation team has conducted a case study to
explore how synthetic data can complement real data in machine learning (ML) model training. The
study specifically examines whether synthetic traffic sign data can improve a perception model’s
traffic sign classification performance. Synthetic data reduces the need for real training data
by 90%. The results of our study show that synthetic data can reduce the need for labeled
real-world data while improving perception model performance on the traffic sign classification
task. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained on both synthetic and real data outperforms
a baseline model trained on real data exclusively. We also show that synthetic data reduces the
need for real training data by 90%. Specifically, a model trained on synthetic data and ten
real-world images per class matched the performance of a model trained on at least 100
real-world images per class.

LG Electronics Partners With Applied Intuition to Train a Camera System for Autonomous Mobile Robots With Synthetic Data (April 12, 2023):
Applied Intuition and LG Electronics are partnering to accelerate the development of camera
systems for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with synthetic training data. LG is a global leader
in technological innovation across various fields, including home appliances, electronic products,
and automobile parts. The company’s Advanced Robotics Laboratory develops AMRs for indoor and
outdoor use cases. Applied provides software solutions to safely develop, test, and deploy
autonomous systems at scale. LG’s Advanced Robotics Lab uses Applied’s Synthetic Datasets to
develop and test its computer vision algorithms. LG is one of the most well-known innovators in
the technology industry, said Qasar Younis, CEO and Co-Founder of Applied Intuition. The company’s
Advanced Robotics Lab recognizes the importance of synthetic data for successful perception
algorithm training. We are proud to collaborate with the team to facilitate faster and more
cost-effective camera system development. The Challenges of Real-World Training Data
Machine learning (ML) algorithms for an AMR’s perception system must be trained and tested on
large amounts of diverse labeled data before they perform well enough to be deployed in a
production environment. Collecting this training data in the real world is often time-consuming,
costly, and dangerous. Labeling the training data can also present challenges, especially when
it is impossible to obtain high-quality ground truth data. Depth and optical flow labels for
camera images, which are typically estimated using lidar sensors, are two examples where it is
difficult to obtain high-quality ground truth. Lidar point clouds typically have a lower density
than the corresponding camera image, resulting in sparse estimated ground truth data with some
camera pixels lacking depth or optical flow values. When used in training, this sparse ground
truth reduces the benefits of ML models. Synthetic training data helps solve the challenges of
real-world data collection and labeling. Instead of being collected in the real world, synthetic
data is generated through sensor simulation. Simulation provides deterministic control over
scene contents, weather, lighting, and more. This makes it easy to define and obtain the exact
data and labels needed to train a model. When training perception models, ML engineers can
combine synthetic data with real data to improve an autonomous system faster and at lower costs.
Applied’s Synthetic Datasets are labeled datasets for ML algorithm development. LG uses Synthetic
Datasets to obtain dense per-pixel depth and stereo disparity ground truth to train stereo vision
algorithms, which are otherwise impractical to obtain. With this ground truth data, LG can
ultimately develop, test, and deploy safer AMRs faster than previously possible.

How May Mobility Uses Applied’s Simulation Software to Make Public Transportation More Safe, Equitable, and Accessible (February 28, 2023):
May Mobility is improving transportation through autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. The Ann
Arbor, Michigan-based company operates autonomous microtransit services across the U.S. and Japan
to complement public transportation and make transit more safe, equitable, and accessible. May
uses Applied Intuition’s large-scale simulation solutions to accelerate its software development
cycle and improve its rider experience while saving time and resources. May’s goal is to provide
alternative transportation solutions that outperform personal car ownership. Our customers don’t
want robotaxis. They want transportation systems that are integrated with their public transit
systems, said Edwin Olson, CEO of May Mobility. We’ll know that May is successful when we can
look at cities and see that they’re built for people and not cars. To accomplish this vision,
May partners with public transit agencies, departments of transportation, and other government
agencies to identify gaps in their public transit systems and fill those gaps with May’s
autonomous microtransit services. The company has had deployments across ten cities in the U.S.
and Japan, and has delivered over 320,000 autonomous rides to date. May’s mission has fascinated
us from the very beginning, said Qasar Younis, Co-Founder and CEO of Applied Intuition. Public
transit is lacking in so many cities in the U.S. and beyond. May is trying to solve this
challenge by helping cities adopt safe autonomous vehicle technology. May uses Applied Intuition’s
solution for large-scale testing to test and deploy safe AV software at a faster rate. The
company uses Applied’s simulator, Simian, and the continuous integration (CI) platform, Orbis,
to run virtual tests in the cloud whenever a new code change is deployed. May has saved countless
engineering hours by conducting a portion of its testing in simulation instead of slower,
costlier, and sometimes dangerous tests in the real world. Applied’s re-simulation platform
Logstream allows May to recreate real-world situations where the safety driver decided to take
control of the vehicle. Logstream lets May replay these situations in a virtual environment and
evaluate whether the vehicle would have handled the situation safely without the driver’s
intervention. Applied’s solution has allowed May to ship faster software updates, offer more
comfortable rides to its customers, and expand into new operational design domains (ODDs). Beyond
strengthening its partnership with Applied and bringing safe AV technology to market faster, May
is looking to deepen its relationships with cities and transit agencies to ensure that AVs reach
their full potential. Right now, AVs are cutting edge. Eventually, they’re going to be
transportation, said Sarah Pressprich Gryniewicz, Strategy Analyst at May Mobility. AVs are on
this journey from really cool high tech to something that changes the world but is maybe not as
glamorous. May is on that journey. It’s so important to work with cities and transit agencies so
that we go on that road together and make sure that AVs reach their full promise and potential.

Data and Logistics: The Lifeblood of Tomorrow’s Joint Operations (December 15, 2022):
It is a truism, even cliché, for military officers to paraphrase this long-held adage throughout
their careers. However, General Barrow famously made these remarks in 1979 when the United States
could reasonably expect unhindered, persistent access to strategic seaports and airfields through
which to deploy personnel and equipment for military operations. As the United States’ strategic
focus shifts to the Indo-Pacific region, the challenge General Barrow describes has become more
acute. The region’s terrain and increasingly advanced adversarial capabilities have laid waste to
old assumptions about gaining access to and setting the theater. Operational forces in the
Indo-Pacific will likely operate in more distributed formations over restrictive terrain.
Sustaining these forces will be a significant challenge since extended supply lines and
persistent logistics hubs are vulnerable to long-range fires. Fortunately, autonomous systems
are uniquely positioned to solve some of the complex logistical problems that will constrain
operations in the Indo-Pacific. In light of these new realities, the Department of Defense (DOD)
is working hard to adapt its capabilities and technologies. This historic modernization effort
includes trusted AI and autonomy, one of the DOD’s 14 critical technology areas. However, as if
on cue from General Barrow himself, most of the debate about integrating autonomous systems into
the Joint Force revolves around combat systems, not how autonomy enables core military activity
such as logistics, engineering, and medical support. This is dangerous given that any operational
force, regardless of its mission, is constrained by its capability to plan and deliver the
personnel and material required to get the job done. Simply stated, the world’s most
technologically sophisticated combat systems are useless without an equally capable logistics force
getting them into action and sustaining them. Autonomous systems are uniquely positioned to solve
complex logistical problems that will likely constrain operations on tomorrow’s battlefields.
These technologies are available today and offer several advantages to logistics operations in all
domains, including increased speed, carrying capacity, and the ability to dynamically re-purpose
elements to support constantly-changing priorities. For example, autonomous systems can de-risk and
increase the efficiency of operations, such as the delivery of logistics packages (LOGPAC) in
contested areas, by using fewer human operators. Autonomous systems also offer solutions to
high-risk battlefield engineering operations. Enormous capacity exists for human-machine teams to
reconnoiter, deploy, or reduce battlefield obstacles. While tactical use cases for autonomy in
sustainment operations are evident, technologies like computer vision (CV) also have immediate
applicability at the strategic level. CV is foundational to autonomous system technology and widely
used by the DOD. Beyond using this technology to develop autonomous vehicles, the DOD made several
investments in CV as a means to reduce the cognitive burden on intelligence analysts and commanders
in previous conflicts. As the United States shifts its attention to preparing for conflict with
peer and near-peer adversaries, the DOD should capitalize on the lessons it learned from previous
investments in CV over the past decade and apply them to today’s challenges. For example, the DOD
could use CV models to determine if aerial and maritime ports can support operations more rapidly
than with current processes. By harnessing CV algorithms that use government and commercial
satellite imagery, analysts can access a continuously updated database of ports. Having access to
this kind of information will enable commanders to make faster and more accurate decisions and get
inside the adversary’s decision-making loop. The use of autonomous systems in sustainment
operations would give the United States and its allies many potential advantages over less
technologically-advanced adversaries. Human-machine teams can conduct critical missions together,
including sustainment operations. These teams represent an economy of force that allows commanders
to prioritize using their service members for other tasks. The use of human-machine teams in
sustainment operations also enables the operationalization of the Joint All-Domain Command and
Control (JADC2) concept. Data collected through distributed and networked platforms used for
sustainment operations enhances situational awareness and allows commanders to make decisions
faster than their adversaries. Collectively, a network of human-machine teams tasked to carry out
sustainment operations offer far more capability than a fleet of manned platforms designed to
carry out the same mission. The good news for commanders and sustainers is that the technologies
required to develop these autonomous systems aren’t a figment of our imagination, but are
available for use today.

Applied’s Log Management Handbook: Log-Based Test Cases (Part 3) (November 10, 2022):
Applied Intuition’s log management handbook explains the journey of a log file from inception to
storage. Our three-part blog post series highlights different parts of the handbook. Read part 1
for an introduction to the log management life cycle. Part 2 lays out log exploration best
practices with a particular emphasis on surfacing interesting events. This third and last part of
our blog post series focuses on one of the workflows that log data enables: Log-based test case
creation. Keep reading to learn more about this topic, or download our full handbook below.
Log-Based Workflows: Within any autonomy program, a variety of different teams leverage log data
for their work. Each team has unique workflows with specific tooling requirements. Triage teams
need to investigate each issue from field testing as quickly as possible. Perception engineers
need to curate datasets for machine learning (ML) model development and evaluate object
tracking performance. Motion planning teams need to create test cases based on logged data to
evaluate planned behavior. A good log management platform should support all of these workflows.
Our log management handbook discusses how triage, perception, prediction, and motion planning
teams can leverage log-based workflows to make the most of their collected log data. The handbook
discusses the following workflows in detail: Triaging issues from the field, Curating datasets to
train ML models, Using ground-truth labels to analyze perception performance, Improving prediction
performance, Improving motion planning performance, Creating test cases from a log, Validating a
supplier module using log data.
Creating Test Cases From a Log: Having a log-based test case creation workflow helps autonomy
programs improve perception, localization, and motion planning modules. Creating test cases from
real-world data is one of the most effective ways to solve long-tail issues found during
real-world testing. The workflow involves the following steps: Create a test case to reproduce
the issue, Step through the test case to debug and root-cause the issue, Make a code change to
resolve the issue, Confirm resolution of the issue by using the test case, Add the test case to
a regression suite to ensure the issue does not reappear.
Reproducing an issue: Test case creation: Creating a test case from a log should be quick—ideally
one or two clicks. Alongside the test case, autonomy programs should also generate pass/fail
rules that determine the test’s outcome. Once they have created a test case, teams should run it
on their most recent autonomy stack to reproduce the issue. There are two ways to create test
cases from a log: Scenario extraction and log re-simulation. Scenario extraction creates a
synthetic test with actor behaviors sampled from the perception outputs in the log. Log
re-simulation replays the original logged data to the autonomy stack without any synthetic
signals. Both these types of test case creation have strengths and weaknesses. With scenario
extraction, the extracted actor behaviors are typically robust to stack changes and portable
between vehicle programs (e.g., an SAE Level 2 (L2) and an L4 autonomy program within the same
organization). Log re-simulation has higher fidelity and is able to losslessly recreate the
exact timing and content of signals sent to the autonomy stack. Our log management handbook
discusses both scenario extraction and log re-simulation in further detail and reveals how
autonomy programs should choose between the two methods. This blog post focuses on log
re-simulation only.
Log re-simulation: The conceptually simplest way to reproduce an issue from a log is to run the
autonomy stack against the previously recorded log. This method is called log replay. Log replay
and log re-simulation both run the original messages or sensor data from the log against the
current autonomy stack. However, log re-simulation adds a simulator into the loop. This simulator
controls signal timing and vehicle dynamics. The addition of the simulator achieves lossless
fidelity and determinism (i.e., the guarantee that, given the same inputs, a simulation will
always produce the same result, no matter how often or on which hardware teams run the
simulation). This provides autonomy programs a greater chance to successfully resolve the
long-tail issue. Because log re-simulation provides a higher degree of determinism than log
replay, it is well suited for test case creation, especially compared to log replay alone.
Autonomy programs can execute log re-simulation in two specific modes: Closed-loop re-simulation
and open-loop re-simulation. Closed-loop re-simulation is most useful for disengagement analysis
and motion planning development (Figure 2). It helps answer the question “What would have happened
if the system continued without intervention”? Closed loop re-simulation involves a vehicle
dynamics model interacting with the controller, and it can become inaccurate if the behavior of
the re-simulated autonomous system diverges too much from the behavior in the original log. Teams
should be careful to keep a re-simulation test accurate when the loop is closed. Open-loop
re-simulation does not involve a vehicle dynamics model, so the position of the autonomous system
in the re-simulation is fixed to the position in the original log. Instead of testing the motion
planning module, open-loop re-simulation helps test perception and localization modules. For
example, testing the perception system in open-loop re-simulation involves playing sensor data
from a log into the perception software, and then grading the output via a scoring mechanism.
Systems engineers, triage teams, and motion planning engineers typically rely on closed-loop
re-simulations, as they must assess the safety of the vehicle’s motion. Perception, prediction,
and localization teams typically rely on open-loop re-simulation, as those module outputs can be
graded without observing a change in vehicle position. For example, a localization system can be
graded based on observing the outputs of the localization module, without involving a downstream
system such as the planning module. Teams should choose the type of re-simulation that is right
for them depending on the type of test case they want to create from a log. Read our full log
management handbook to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of log re-simulation and
when autonomy programs should opt for scenario extraction instead.
Resolving the issue: Once autonomy programs have reproduced an issue by creating a test case and
receiving a failing result, they can now resolve the issue locally by using real data from the
log to improve their autonomy stack. The log-based test case creation workflow makes this possible.
The team should iteratively modify the autonomy stack and re-run the created test case. This
iteration loop should be as quick as possible. Once the test passes, the stack changes are
considered a true fix. It is important to note that a passing result for the created test case
does not reduce the need for other software testing such as integration and unit tests.
Ensuring the issue does not re-appear: Successful autonomy programs ensure that their autonomous
system does not fail twice in the same way. After reproducing and resolving a long-tail issue
locally, teams should add the created test case to a regression test suite that regularly executes
comprehensive tests in continuous integration (CI). If a long-tail issue appears unsolvable due
to sensor or computing deficiencies, programs can add it to a progression test suite that
evaluates the stack’s progress toward aspirational goals. Programs should also create dashboards
that monitor the overall health of their autonomy stack and give all team members a high-level
overview of stack performance over time. In addition to these steps of the log-based test case
creation workflow, our handbook also lays out how autonomy programs can utilize advanced
re-simulation techniques such as fuzzing to stress-test their system even further. For example,
fuzzing a test case allows teams to make a cut-in scenario more aggressive by changing the
distance between the autonomous system and the vehicle that is cutting in front of it. Teams can
create multiple test cases with different distances to find out where failures occur. Different
teams within an autonomy program can leverage different log-based workflows to power their
autonomous systems development. The log-based test case creation workflow allows perception,
localization, and motion planning teams to reproduce a real-world issue using scenario creation
or log re-simulation, debug the issue, resolve it, and ensure it does not reappear. Learn more
about log-based workflows and other parts of the log management process in our log management
handbook.

Applied Hosts Delegation from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering (November 8, 2022):
Applied Intuition proudly hosted a delegation from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View,
California. OUSD (R&E) visited Applied to learn about commercial best practices for autonomy
development and how those best practices could be applied to a range of autonomy programs within
the Department of Defense (DOD). The delegation from OUSD (R&E) included a number of senior
decision-makers, including: Mr. Maynard Holliday, Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Critical
Technologies; Dr. Kimberly Sablon, Principal Director for Trusted Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Autonomy; Dr. Dev Shenoy, Principal Director for Microelectronics; Dr. Jaret C. Riddick,
Director of Autonomy; CAPT Thomas Eisenstatt, Military Assistant to the Deputy Chief Technology
Officer for Critical Technologies. Building warfighter trust in autonomous systems is a key
priority for OUSD (R&E), said Maynard Holliday, Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Critical
Technologies. Ongoing collaboration between the DOD and innovative commercial companies will prove
essential to building trust and promoting principles of responsible AI. As the number of defense
autonomy programs expands, the DOD must continue to harness commercial best practices for autonomy
development and program design to ensure mission success. The delegation received a presentation
on commercially-proven best practices and program architecture for autonomous systems development,
including ways in which DOD could incorporate those best practices into their defense autonomy
programs to deliver innovative capabilities to the warfighter at speed and scale. Then, after
receiving a demonstration of Applied Intuition’s end-to-end autonomy development toolchain, the
delegation discussed a series of potential use cases for OUSD (R&E), including multi-domain
autonomy and multi-agent mission planning, building warfighter trust by tracking testing progress
against requirements, and more. I was honored to welcome the delegation from OUSD (R&E) to
Applied Intuition’s headquarters, said Colin Carroll, Head of Government at Applied Intuition. We
were grateful for the opportunity to share best practices for autonomous systems development based
on our leadership in the commercial autonomy sector, as well as our growing team’s experiences
from across the DOD. Commercial companies continue to take the lead in developing solutions for
autonomous systems. It’s important that we share our lessons learned with leaders in the DOD to
ensure that needed capabilities are delivered to warfighters when and where they need them. We
would like to thank our guests for their continued efforts to bring commercial expertise to the
DOD and are proud of our continued leadership in engaging decision-makers from across the national
security community about the imperative for autonomy.

Applied’s Log Management Handbook: Log Exploration (Part 2) (November 1, 2022):
This blog post is the second in a three-part series highlighting different topics from Applied’s
log data management handbook for autonomous systems development. Read part 1 for an introduction
to the log management life cycle and the different workflows powered by log data. This second part
lays out log exploration best practices with a particular emphasis on surfacing interesting events.
Keep reading to learn more about this topic, or access our full handbook below.
What Is Log Exploration?: Log exploration is an important part of the log management life cycle.
After an autonomy program collects log files, data processing pipelines convert these files into
usable formats, and different teams explore them according to their specific use cases. In order
to extract value from logs, programs need to process large amounts of collected data and build
indices to enable faster data retrieval. They can then enrich data with offline algorithms,
surface interesting events, visualize data, and analyze system performance and operational design
domain (ODD) coverage. While our log management handbook discusses each of these steps in detail,
this blog post focuses on surfacing interesting events.
Surfacing Interesting Events for Review: The work of triage operations teams, algorithm engineers,
and other users of log data involves identifying relevant events in the log data and reviewing
those events to evaluate the autonomous system’s performance. Today’s SAE Level 2 (L2) and L3
autonomous systems already record events such as hard braking, acceleration, and jerk. The
following sections outline which other types of events autonomy programs should surface and how
validation, motion planning, and perception teams can best surface these events.
Surfacing operator disengagements and system escalations: All interventions that occur while an
autonomous system is engaged should be surfaced for review. Interventions include operator
disengagements (i.e., situations where the safety operator intervenes to disengage autonomous mode
in L4 autonomous systems) and system escalations (i.e., situations where the safety operator or
the vehicle owner intervenes to take control of an L2 or L3 autonomous system). If available, the
surfaced events should include relevant safety operator comments. Safety operator comments can
help teams quickly review and root cause events that may have been caused by a system failure.
Surfaced events might also contain the autonomous system’s intended maneuver, the behavior of
nearby actors, and information such as map information that helps teams classify an event as
occurring inside or outside of the autonomous system’s ODD.
Validation and motion planning teams: Scenario tags: Scenario tags assist validation and motion
planning teams in evaluating their autonomous system’s performance. Validation teams can use
scenario tags to find scenarios that match a specific situation. Scenario tags often combine
behavior annotation, map or geographic information, and ODD data. For example, scenario tags help
surface scenarios such as “lane change on highway” and “actor cut-in during rain.” Validation
teams can then perform aggregate analysis on scenarios with the same tags to understand how the
autonomous system tends to perform in specific situations. Motion planning teams can combine
scenario tags to create human descriptions of especially difficult situations. For example,
filtering by “vehicle pulling out of parking spot” and “bicyclist adjacent” will surface edge
cases that are relevant to every motion planning team.
Perception teams: Automatic error detection: Autonomous systems development involves abundant
unlabeled raw data. Unfortunately, high-quality labels are often expensive to obtain, and labeling
common scenarios such as standard highway driving has diminishing returns on perception model
performance. A perception model should thus be trained on data that was incorrectly classified
by previous versions of the model (Figure 2). Perception teams can implement a process to
identify these cases in logged data automatically. To surface potential errors automatically,
perception teams can compare the output of the on-vehicle model to the output of a more powerful
offline perception model and find cases where the two models disagree. These discrepancies likely
indicate errors in the on-vehicle perception stack and should be sent to a team member for manual
review and labeling.
Surfacing anomalies: Beyond finding specific predefined events, autonomy programs typically find
it useful to surface unpredicted anomalies in their log data for manual review. Anomalies can
include known scenarios with unexpected metrics for pre-chosen dimensions (e.g., the most
aggressive cut-ins) and unseen edge cases surfaced through machine learning (ML). A common
ML-based anomaly detection technique leverages unsupervised learning to detect unexpected data.
Teams train an ML model on a subset of the most relevant channels in their log data to predict
the next timestamp based on a window of historical data. This model then runs on a log and
surfaces events for which it has the largest prediction gap. These are the cases where the
autonomous system behaved in the most unexpected way according to existing data, or a sub-system
behaved unpredictably. Automated anomaly detection is an ongoing area of research. However, it
is increasingly popular among autonomy programs that face the limits of automation when combing
through petabytes of log data.
Conclusion: Surfacing and reviewing interesting events is an essential step in every autonomy program’s log
exploration process. Teams can leverage different techniques to surface operator disengagements,
system escalations, anomalies, and other events that help validation, perception, and motion
planning teams evaluate their autonomous system. To learn about other steps in the log exploration
process, such as data processing, enrichment, visualization, and analysis, download our full
handbook below, and stay tuned for the third and last part of our blog post series.
